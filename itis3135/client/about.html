        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>The 49ers Racing Vehicle Dynamics Subteam is dedicated to advancing the field of vehicle dynamics
             through innovative research and practical applications. Our team consists of passionate engineering 
             students who work together to design, test, and optimize a Formula SAE car.</p>
        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>Formula SAE is an international collegiate design competition that challenges students to design,
            build, and drive a Formula style racecar. The Vehicle Dynamics Subteam focuses on the performance
            of the car, including the suspension and tires. By applying engineering principles students learn
            how to optimize the car's handling and performance on the track.</p>
