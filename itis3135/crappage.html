    <h1>CRAP Design Comparison</h1>
    <main>
        <h2>CRAP Design</h2>
        <p>CRAP is an acronym for Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity. These four principles are the foundation of effective design. Contrast helps to create visual interest and draw the viewer's attention to the most important elements on the page. Repetition helps to create a sense of unity and consistency throughout the design. Alignment helps to create a sense of order and organization, making it easier for the viewer to navigate the page. Proximity helps to create relationships between elements and group related content together. By applying these principles to your designs, you can create visually appealing and effective layouts that engage and inform your audience.</p>
        <h2>CRAP Examples</h2>
        <p>Here are some examples of how the CRAP principles can be applied to design:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Using contrasting colors, fonts, or sizes to make important elements stand out.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Using consistent colors, fonts, or styles throughout a design to create a cohesive look.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Aligning elements along a grid or axis to create a sense of order and structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Grouping related elements together to create visual relationships and hierarchy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A well-designed page example is <a href="https://www.jayski.com/">jayski.com</a>, and a poorly designed page example is <a href="https://www.angelfire.com/super/badwebs/">angelfire.com/super/badwebs</a>.</p>
        <h2>Page Comparison</h2>
        <p>jayski.com represents good design practice, using simple consistent design and themes with contrasting headers and main text.</p>
        <p>angelfire.com/super/badwebs represents poor design practice, using a cluttered layout with inconsistent fonts and colors, making it difficult to read and navigate.</p>
