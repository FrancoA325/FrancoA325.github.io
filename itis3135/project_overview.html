            <h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
            <p><strong>JavaScript-based interactivity:</strong> On the <em>Photos and Media</em> page, a lightbox gallery will be used to allow users to view images in an interactive format. On the <em>CAD Design and Notes</em> page, a 3D viewer for CAD models will let users interact with designs. The <em>Calculators and Tools</em> page will have custom-built calculators for suspension setup, tire force analysis, with interaction using JavaScript.</p>
            <p>Example of interactivity inspiration: <a href="https://calculator.academy/motion-ratio-calculator/" target="_blank">Online Motion Ratio Calculator</a></p>
