        <h1>Weather Prediction Experiments</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>I chose this project because .</p>
            <img src="/weatherPhotos/dataset.png" alt="Dataset Preview">
            <p>By utilizing statistical measures such as mean absolute error and R-squared values, 
                I gained insights into the performance of each regression model and their 
                suitability for weather prediction tasks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Linear Regression Experiment</h2>
            <p>For the first experiment, I applied linear regression to the weather dataset. 
                This method aims to establish a linear relationship between input features 
                such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, and the target variable, which 
                in this case, is the precipitation level. Despite its simplicity, linear 
                regression provided a baseline for predicting weather patterns.</p>
            <img src="/weatherPhotos/linreg_result.png" alt="Linear Regression Results">
            <p>The results of the linear regression experiment revealed a moderate 
                level of accuracy in predicting precipitation levels. However, 
                the model's performance varied depending on the complexity of the 
                weather patterns.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Random Forest Regression Experiment</h2>
            <p>Building upon the insights gained from the linear regression experiment, 
                I proceeded to implement random forest regression. This ensemble learning 
                technique leverages multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy 
                and mitigate overfitting. By harnessing the power of parallel computation 
                and feature randomness, random forest regression offers a robust solution 
                for weather forecasting.</p>
            <img src="/weatherPhotos/random_forest_result.png" alt="Random Forest Regression Results">
            <p>The random forest regression experiment yielded promising results, 
                demonstrating enhanced predictive capabilities compared to linear regression.
                 The model's ability to capture nonlinear relationships and handle large datasets
                  contributed to its effectiveness in weather prediction.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Decision Tree Regression Experiment</h2>
            <p>Lastly, I conducted an experiment using decision tree regression, 
                a non-parametric supervised learning technique. Decision trees partition the 
                feature space into hierarchical structures, enabling interpretable predictions 
                based on simple decision rules. Despite their susceptibility to overfitting, 
                decision tree regression models offer valuable insights into the underlying 
                patterns present in weather data.</p>
            <img src="/weatherPhotos/decision_tree_result.png" alt="Decision Tree Regression Results">
            <p>The decision tree regression experiment showcased the model's ability to capture 
                intricate relationships within the weather dataset. By iteratively splitting the 
                feature space, decision trees provided intuitive predictions, albeit with some 
                limitations in handling complex interactions.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Findings and Impact</h2>
            <p>Through rigorous experimentation with various regression techniques, 
                I gained valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities 
                associated with weather prediction. While linear regression provided
                 a simple yet interpretable approach, random forest regression and 
                 decision tree regression offered superior performance in capturing 
                 the nuances of weather patterns.</p>
            <p>The findings from this project underscore the importance of employing 
                advanced machine learning algorithms in weather forecasting tasks. 
                By harnessing the collective intelligence of ensemble methods and 
                non-parametric models, meteorologists and climate scientists can improve
                 the accuracy and reliability of weather predictions, thereby enhancing 
                 public safety and resource allocation.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the ethical implications of this project center around 
                responsible data usage and transparency in model development. 
                By adhering to ethical guidelines and promoting open access 
                to weather data and research findings, we can foster collaboration and 
                innovation in the field of meteorology while ensuring accountability and 
                trustworthiness.</p>
