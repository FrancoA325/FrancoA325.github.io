        <h1>Weather Prediction Experiments</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>I chose this project because the 49ers Racing FSAE team goes to competition in May in Jackson, MI. The weather plays such
                a large role in the performance of a racecar that it can be beneficial to try and create a model to make temperature predictions. 
                I started to try and find a dataset that contained historical weather data for the lansing area for the month of May. I found a site
                that contained historical NOAA data that I could search location and times.
            </p>
            <h2>Data and Processing</h2>
            <img src="/weatherPhotos/initData.png" alt="Initial Data">
            <p>The above image shows a snippet of the data with each of the channels. The biggest issues that I encountered
                were related to the date channel, I had data that spanned 2018-2023 but having the year threw off initial plotting.
                Part of my initial processing includes looking at the generic distrobutions of a few of the columns to see if any of
                the data is skewed or anything that looks completely useless.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Linear Regression Experiment</h2>
            <p>I started by building a linear regression model for the dataset. I decided to use the 'MaxTmp', and 'Depart' columns
                for the X. And for the Y, I am using the AvgTmp variable because that is the target metric. It's important to note that
                after some X experimentation, the models would be overtrained with too many of the columns included. The image below shows
                where the X and y are initialized, the training and test split for the model, and testing the model. To test the model I used 
                MSE, MAE, and RMSE.
            </p>
            <img src="/weatherPhotos/Model1.png" alt="LinReg Training">
            <p>The results of the linear regression experiment revealed a high level of accuracy. To try and test and represent the model
                I created some plots with data from each May 2018-2023 where I had the model predict AvgTmp and built a simple line of best fit.
                I also included plots with a polynomial fit for linear regression and the rest of the models.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Random Forest Regression Experiment</h2>
            <p>Building upon the insights gained from the linear regression experiment, 
                I proceeded to implement random forest regression. This ensemble learning 
                technique uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy 
                and mitigate overfitting. The random forest integration is similar to linear regression in 
                initialization and fitting.</p>
            <p>Using the same metrics for the random trees and plotting the same data, we can look at the overall fitting quality.
                The following images show the fitting and the plotting of the new model. In general it seems that random forest is 
                doing a better job of making predictions.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Decision Tree Regression Experiment</h2>
            <p>Lastly, I conducted an experiment using decision tree regression, 
                a non-parametric supervised learning technique. Decision trees partition the 
                feature space into hierarchical structures, enabling interpretable predictions 
                based on simple decision rules. Despite their susceptibility to overfitting, 
                decision tree regression models offer valuable insights into the underlying 
                patterns present in weather data.</p>
            <p>The decision tree regression experiment effectively predicted the AvgTmp. The metrics were calculated the same as the other 
                models. Plotting of the data is also similar, and it is clear to see that the differences in predictions across all of the models
                is neglegable and I think that any one of them could be used in a practical application.

            <h2>Findings and Impact</h2>
            <p>Through rigorous experimentation with various regression techniques, 
                I gained valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities 
                associated with weather prediction. While linear regression provided
                 a simple yet interpretable approach, random forest regression and 
                 decision tree regression offered superior performance in making my weather predictions.</p>
            <p>The findings from this project underscore the importance of employing 
                advanced machine learning algorithms in weather forecasting tasks. 
                By harnessing the collective intelligence of ensemble methods and 
                non-parametric models, meteorologists and climate scientists can improve
                 the accuracy and reliability of weather predictions.</p>
            <p>The ethical implications of this project center around 
                responsible data usage and transparency in model development. 
                By adhering to ethical guidelines and promoting open access 
                to weather data and research findings, we can foster collaboration and 
                innovation in the field of meteorology while ensuring accountability and 
                trustworthiness.</p>
