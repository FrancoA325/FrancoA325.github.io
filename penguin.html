    <h1>Penguin Clustering</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>The idea for this project came when I initially found the dataset on kaggle. The dataset 
            fits well for building a classification model. A classification model is a class of 
            machine learning algorithims that groups categories of a dataset based on similarities 
            found in each of the parameters. As its implied classification is used when we want 
            to classify data into types. The specific type of classification that I am using in this 
            project is a KMeans classification from sklearn.KMeans is an unsupervised learning algorithm 
            that iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest cluster centroid and then recalculates 
            the centroids based on the mean of the data points assigned to each cluster, aiming to minimize 
            the within-cluster variance. This process continues until convergence, resulting in distinct clusters 
            that group similar data points together.

        <h2>Processing and Data Visualization</h2>
        <p>Some initial data adjustments need to be made. I started by dropping null values and and doing some 
            encoding of the 'sex' column. The below images show code and outputs for the initial data exploration 
            and adjustments.
        </p>
        <p>With the initial understanding of the data, I wanted to do some initial plotting and 
            created a pairplot for the dataset so that I could look at data inteactions and 
            distrobuions with male and females.
        </p>

        <p>In order to use the data in the KMeans model, I needed to scale each of the data columns. Scaling is important in KMeans as it ensures
            that all of the features will contribute equally to the calculation of centroids. Without scaling, some of the data columns 
            can skew the clustering results. The image below is some of the scaled data.
        </p>
        <img src="/penguinPhotos/Scale.png" alt="Image 3">
        <p>Before we look at the KMeans model building I decided to create a starting point 
            for K value. I decided to create an elbow method plot to show the optimal number of 
            clusters. The elbow method plot below shows that after K = 4, there is not a notable 
            increase in the interia. In this section we also take the data and apply PCA. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
            is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the original data into a lower-dimensional space while 
            preserving most of its variance. This transformation helps in reducing the computational 
            complexity of the clustering algorithm while retaining the essential information needed for clustering.
            he primary focus of this model building phase is on plotting.

        <h2>Model Building</h2>
        <p>The model building section of the project begins by specifying the number of clusters and a random state. The "random state" parameter is used to 
            initialize the internal random number generator, which is crucial for reproducibility. By setting a specific random state, we ensure that the 
            clustering results remain consistent across multiple runs of the algorithm, making our analysis reproducible.
        After specifying the number of clusters and random state, we proceed to fit the cleaned PCA data.We visualize all of the data points 
        colored per cluster, with each centroid marked as a species. This visualization provides a clear understanding of how the KMeans algorithm 
        clusters similar data observations into distinct groups, aiding in the interpretation of the results.

        <h2>Findings and Impact</h2>
        <p>Overall, it is evident how KMeans clustering effectively groups similar data observations from our penguin dataset into distinct species. 
            Each of the clusters is clearly denoted, which validates our decision to use 4 clusters.</p>
        
        <p>mplications for Environmental Science:</p>
        <p>Understanding the clustering of penguin species has significant implications for environmental science and conservation efforts. 
            By identifying distinct clusters representing different species, researchers gain insights into penguin population dynamics, habitat preferences, 
            and geographical distributions. This information is crucial for assessing the health of penguin populations, identifying areas of conservation concern, 
            and developing targeted strategies for habitat protection and species preservation.</p>
        
        <p>Ethical Considerations of Clustering Models:</p>
        <p>Clustering models offer several positive ethical aspects, such as facilitating data-driven decision-making, identifying patterns 
            and trends in large datasets, and aiding in scientific research and discovery. However, there are also ethical concerns associated with the use of clustering models.</p>
        
        <p>Positives:</p>
        <p>Efficiency: Clustering models can streamline data analysis processes, allowing researchers to uncover 
            insights and patterns more quickly.</p>
        <p>Objectivity: Clustering algorithms provide an objective way to group data based on similarities, reducing the 
            potential for bias in decision-making.</p>
        
        <p>Negatives:</p>
        <p>Privacy: Clustering models may inadvertently reveal sensitive information about individuals or groups, 
            raising privacy concerns.</p>
        <p>Biases: The outcome of clustering models can be influenced by biases present in the data, leading to 
            unfair or inaccurate conclusions.</p>
        <p>Unintended Consequences: Decisions made based on clustering results may have unintended consequences for individuals or communities, 
            highlighting the need for careful consideration of ethical implications.</p>
