    <h1>Airline Delay Causes</h1>

        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>In seeking a suitable dataset for this project, I aimed to strike a balance between adequacy in size for training 
            a simple KNN model and manageability for processing. The chosen dataset comprises measurements for various bills, 
            providing a foundation for training a model to identify counterfeit bills based on their size and general measurements. 
            Given the global challenge posed by counterfeit currency to financial systems, our objective was clear: to develop a 
            model capable of accurately discerning between genuine and fake bills solely through their size properties. 
        </p>
        <p>I started to look a the data that was in the dataset and get an idea of the parameters. 
            I started with .describe() and  .head(). I then plotted the data distrobutions for each
            of the columns.

        <h2>Modeling</h2>
        <p>Before I could start modeling the data I needed to do some more data management. Initially, 
            any rows containing missing values were removed from the dataset. The remaining dataset was then divided 
            into two subsets: one containing the measurements of the bills (xData) and another containing the corresponding 
            labels indicating whether each bill was genuine or counterfeit (yData). Following this, 
            the dataset was split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.
            I then used scikit-learn's SimpleImputer to handle any of the missing values in the data and replaced 
            them with the mean of the given channel and the means were calculated with the training data. 
            Imputation was applied to to both the train and test subsets and the complete datasets are ready 
            for training and evaluation of the model.
        </p>

        <p>The next step for the project was to create and train the KNN classifier model. Using the KNeighborsClassifier 
            function, I set the K nearest neighbors to 3 and then used .fit() to fit my X and Y training data. With the 
            model trained I could test and do some analysis. 
        </p>

        <p>To test the model I use .predict() on the imputed x test data. To check the accuracy I compared the yTest and yPredict
            values to output a percentage accuracy. I also wanted to create a confusion matrix to better visualize the 
            models predictions. I still wanted to do some more analysis so I calculated a p value

        <h2>Findings and Impact</h2>
        <p>At the project's start, my aim was to find a singular cause for airline delays, but the data revealed a number 
            of factors influencing flight disruptions. While weather conditions and airport operations remain beyond our control, 
            the data analyzed highlights key considerations when seeking to address this issue. The graphs indicate that selecting an 
            airline and strategically scheduling flights during favorable weather conditions can mitigate delays. Notably, 
            larger airlines, despite encountering a higher volume of delayed flights due to their extensive operations, 
            exhibit efficiency in managing crew issues, unexpected weather, and heavy air traffic. 
            Despite the increased total number of delays, larger airlines consistently spend less time delayed per 
            flight compared to their smaller counterparts.</p>
        <p>In response to the question of the biggest cause of airline delays, 
            it appears that inclement weather and issues with the National Aviation System are primary contributors. 
            Additionally, the size of the airline itself plays a significant role.</p>
        <p>Concerning the ethical considerations, it's reassuring that the visualizations and data used 
            in the project don't pose any harm. The visualizations depict general trends in broad travel data, 
            and the dataset comes from a freely available Kaggle set without any focus on specific individuals or 
            illicit data collection. </p>
